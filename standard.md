# Discord Bot Currency Standard
*Drafted by austinhuang#1076.*

Sometimes your users found hard to earn a specific virtual currency on a specific bot that they enjoy. Sometimes your users found easy to earn another currency on another bot but they have nowhere to use it. For these reasons your users will abandon both bots and turn to a bot that allow them to earn and use the currency wisely.

Introducing **Discoin**, a universal currency allowing users to exchange currencies from one bot to another bot.

## Definition of a central currency
**Discoin** is a currency that is __solely used to be exchanged into other bots' currencies.__ It can be traded between users.

Exchange rates with other bot currencies are discussed based on rarity. They're fixed unless methods used to earn currencies has changed significantly.

## Technology
A central *guild* should be created so that each participating bot can send message and receive message to process transactions.
